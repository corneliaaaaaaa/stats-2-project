# stats-2-project
We use Spotify top hits in 2018, 2019, 2020 as target data to analyze aspects of popular music. The code file is part of the project and contains the following sections:
- Find common properties of top hits from the 2 groups - new musicians and experienced musicians
- Use the properties found in the previous section to build a regression model to predict whether a song will become a top hit
